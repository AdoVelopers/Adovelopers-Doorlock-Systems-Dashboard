# Fingerprint Door Lock System

## Overview
The **Fingerprint Door Lock System** is a biometric-based access control solution that leverages fingerprint scanning technology to secure doors and restrict access. This system ensures that only authorized personnel can access specific areas, enhancing both physical security and convenience. 

## Features
- **Biometric Authentication**: Uses fingerprints for identifying individuals, eliminating the need for keys, access cards, or passwords.
- **Real-time Access Logs**: Records successful and failed access attempts with timestamped logs.
- **Admin Panel**: A web or mobile interface for administrators to manage user access, register new fingerprints, and view logs.
- **Multi-User Support**: Supports multiple authorized users, each with a unique fingerprint.
- **Emergency Override**: Optional access methods in case of system failure or emergencies, such as a manual key or backup code.
- **Energy Efficient**: Designed to be low-power and can run on battery for extended periods.

## Components
The system comprises the following key components:
1. **Fingerprint Sensor**: Captures and verifies fingerprints.
2. **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)**: Handles fingerprint data and controls the locking mechanism.
3. **Solenoid or Servo Lock**: Physical mechanism for locking/unlocking the door.
4. **User Interface**: A keypad or touchscreen for alternate authentication methods (optional).
5. **Power Supply**: Can be powered by either an AC adapter or battery.
6. **Admin Software**: Web or mobile application for user management and monitoring access logs.
